# Quiz Visibility Feature

## Overview
Every challenger can now create quizzes with two visibility options:
- **Public**: Anyone can find and take the quiz
- **Private**: Only the creator can take the quiz (for personal practice/testing)

## Database Changes

### New Column: `visibility`
Added to `quizzes` table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE quizzes 
ADD COLUMN visibility TEXT DEFAULT 'public' CHECK (visibility IN ('public', 'private'));
```

### Updated RLS Policies

**Quizzes Table:**
- `Challengers can view quizzes based on visibility`: Users can see public quizzes + their own private quizzes
- Other policies remain (create, update, delete by owner)

**Questions Table:**
- `Challengers can view questions based on quiz visibility`: Respects parent quiz visibility
- Users can manage questions only for their own quizzes

**Quiz Attempts Table:**
- `Challengers can create attempts for accessible quizzes`: Can attempt public quizzes + own private quizzes
- `Challengers can view own attempts or attempts on own quizzes`: Creators can see who took their public quizzes

## API Updates

### POST /api/quizzes
Now accepts `visibility` field:
```json
{
  "title": "My Quiz",
  "description": "...",
  "duration_minutes": 15,
  "visibility": "public",  // or "private"
  "questions": [...]
}
```

Validates visibility is either "public" or "private".
