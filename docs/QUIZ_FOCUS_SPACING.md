## Design Principles Applied

### 1. **Focused Attention**
The increased white space creates a "spotlight" effect on the current question, naturally drawing the user's eye to what matters.

### 2. **Visual Breathing Room**
More padding prevents the feeling of cramped content, reducing cognitive load and eye strain.

### 3. **Consistent Hierarchy**
- Question: Largest, boldest
- Badges: Small, subtle
- Options: Medium size, clear but secondary

### 4. **Subtle Refinement**
Changes are noticeable but not dramatic - it feels more polished rather than completely different.

### 5. **Mobile Optimization**
White space helps on smaller screens where touch targets benefit from generous padding.

## Summary

**Goal**: Add balanced white space and refine typography to improve focus on quiz questions.

**Approach**:
1. Increased card padding by 50% (base) for breathing room

4. Fixed answer option text at small size for consistency
5. Increased spacing between answer options for comfort

**Result**: A more focused, comfortable, and professional quiz-taking experience with better visual hierarchy and improved readability. The question card now commands attention without feeling overwhelming, and the refined typography creates a polished, premium feel.

**Balance**: The changes create noticeable improvement without going overboard - there's plenty of white space for focus and breathing room, but it still feels efficient and purposeful rather than wastefully sparse.
