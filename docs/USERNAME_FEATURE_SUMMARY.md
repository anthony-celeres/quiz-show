# Username Feature - Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

### ✅ Database Layer
1. **Migration File**: `db/migrations/2025-10-19-add-user-profiles.sql`
   - Creates `profiles` table with username and display_name
   - Adds unique constraint and validation for usernames
   - Creates indexes for performance
   - Sets up RLS policies (anyone can view, users can manage own)
   - Auto-creates profile on user signup via trigger
   - Migrates existing users with default usernames
   - Creates views: `quizzes_with_creators` and `quiz_attempts_with_profiles`

### ✅ Type Definitions
2. **Updated**: `types/quiz.ts`
   - Added `Profile` interface
   - Added `QuizWithCreator` interface (extends Quiz)
   - Added `QuizAttemptWithProfile` interface (extends QuizAttempt)

### ✅ API Endpoints
3. **New**: `app/api/profile/route.ts`
   - GET: Fetch current user's profile
   - POST: Create new profile
   - PUT: Update existing profile
   - Validates username format and uniqueness

### ✅ Components
4. **New**: `components/UsernameSetup.tsx`
   - Form for setting/updating username
   - Real-time validation
   - Displays success state
   - Can be used standalone or embedded

5. **Updated**: `app/challenger/quizzes/page.client.tsx`
   - Now fetches from `quizzes_with_creators` view
   - Displays creator username on quiz cards
   - Shows "by [creator]" for quizzes created by others

6. **Updated**: `components/Leaderboard.tsx`
   - Fetches from `quiz_attempts_with_profiles` view
   - Displays username/display name instead of email
   - Shows @username as secondary identifier

7. **Updated**: `components/QuizLeaderboard.tsx`
   - Fetches from `quiz_attempts_with_profiles` view
   - Displays username/display name for each attempt

   - Uses UsernameSetup component
   - Accessible via navigation

9. **Updated**: `app/challenger/layout.client.tsx`
   - Added "Profile" link to navigation menu

### ✅ Documentation
10. **New**: `docs/USERNAME_FEATURE.md`
    - Complete feature documentation
    - Database structure details
    - API endpoints reference
    - User flow descriptions
    - Future enhancement ideas

## How It Works

### For New Users
1. User registers → Trigger creates profile with default username (from email)
2. User can visit `/challenger/profile` to customize username
3. Username appears on their created quizzes and leaderboard entries

### For Existing Users
1. Migration creates profile with default username (email prefix + user ID)
2. User can update username at `/challenger/profile`
3. Changes reflect immediately across the app

### Quiz Attribution
- When viewing quizzes, creator's username is displayed
- Format: "by [Display Name or @username]"
- Only shown for quizzes created by other users

### Leaderboard Display
- Shows usernames instead of emails
- Priority: Display Name → Username → Email (fallback)
- @username shown as secondary identifier

## Next Steps

### 1. Run the Migration
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
-- Copy and paste contents of: db/migrations/2025-10-19-add-user-profiles.sql
```

### 2. Test the Feature
- Register a new user and verify default username is created
- Visit `/challenger/profile` to update username
- Create a quiz and verify your username appears on it
- Check the leaderboard to see usernames displayed
- Try updating your username and verify changes appear everywhere

### 3. Optional Enhancements
Consider adding:
- Username prompt during registration flow
- Profile picture/avatar support
- User search by username
- Username change history
- Validation for inappropriate usernames
- Rate limiting on username changes

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run database migration successfully
- [ ] Register a new user and verify profile is auto-created
- [ ] Access `/challenger/profile` page
- [ ] Update username successfully
- [ ] Try invalid username formats (should show errors)
- [ ] Try duplicate username (should show error)
- [ ] Create a quiz and verify your username appears
- [ ] View quiz created by another user (should see their username)
- [ ] Check global leaderboard shows usernames
- [ ] Check quiz-specific leaderboard shows usernames
- [ ] Verify username changes propagate everywhere

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Issues
- Ensure Supabase connection is active
- Check for existing tables/views with same names
- Verify auth.users table has users before migrating

### Username Not Showing
- Check if profile was created (query `profiles` table)
- Verify views are created correctly
- Check RLS policies are enabled

### API Errors
- Verify Supabase client is initialized
- Check authentication is working
- Ensure user is logged in when calling endpoints

## Security Considerations

✅ **Implemented**:
- Username validation (length, format, uniqueness)
- RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- Users can only modify their own profiles
- Public read access for leaderboards and attribution

⚠️ **Consider Adding**:
- Rate limiting on username changes
- Profanity filter for usernames
- Username reservation/blacklist
- Audit log for username changes
