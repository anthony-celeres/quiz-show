# Quiz Creation Feature - Complete Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Missing Questions API
**Problem**: Creating a quiz failed with "Unexpected token '<'" error because the `/api/questions` endpoint didn't exist.

**Solution**: Created `app/api/questions/route.ts` with:
- POST endpoint to create questions
- Validates user owns the quiz
- Supports all question types (multiple, identification, truefalse)
- Proper error handling

### 2. Missing Question Types
**Problem**: Quiz form only supported text-based questions (identification).

**Solution**: Added full question type support:
- **Text Answer (Identification)**: Free text response
- **Multiple Choice**: Multiple options with correct answer selection
- **True/False**: Boolean choice
