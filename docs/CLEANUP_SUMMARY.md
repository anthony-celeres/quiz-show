### Student Routes (7 files)

## Why Files Were "Red"

The "red files" in your IDE were:
1. **Deleted admin/student route files** - Removed during role migration
2. **Git tracking issue** - Files were deleted but not committed
3. **IDE cache** - VS Code was still showing them in the file explorer

## Solution Applied

1. ✅ Staged all deletions: `git add -A`
2. ✅ Committed changes: Two commits made
   - Commit 1: Removed admin/student routes
   - Commit 2: Removed admin components folder
3. ✅ Cleaned working tree

## Verification

Run to verify clean state:
```bash
git status
```

Expected output:
```
On branch develop
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/develop' by 2 commits.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Files cleaned up
2. 🔄 **Restart VS Code** to clear IDE cache (recommended)
3. 🔄 Run **Developer: Reload Window** command in VS Code
4. 📤 Push changes to remote: `git push origin develop`
5. 🗄️ Run database migration in Supabase SQL Editor

## Summary

- **Deleted**: 18 obsolete files (admin routes + components)
- **Migrated**: 7 student routes → challenger routes
- **Kept**: 2 student components (actively used)
- **Created**: 13 new challenger routes + 3 new components
- **Result**: Clean, unified challenger role system ✅

All "red files" are now properly removed from git tracking!
