# Quiz Edit and Delete Features

## Overview
Added functionality to edit and delete quizzes from the challenger dashboard.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Edit Quiz Functionality
- **Route**: `/challenger/quizzes/[quizId]/edit`
- **Components**:
  - `app/challenger/quizzes/[quizId]/edit/page.tsx` - Edit page wrapper
  - `components/ChallengerQuizEditForm.tsx` - Fetches quiz data and renders form
  - Updated `components/ChallengerQuizForm.tsx` - Now handles both create and update operations

**How it works**:
1. Click the Edit (pencil) icon on any quiz you created
2. The form loads with existing quiz data pre-filled
3. Modify title, description, duration, or visibility
4. Click "Update Quiz" to save changes
5. Redirects back to quizzes list

**Note**: Currently only updates quiz metadata (title, description, duration, visibility). Question editing will be enhanced in a future update.

### 2. Delete Quiz Functionality
- **API**: Uses existing `DELETE /api/quizzes/[quizId]` endpoint
- **Components**: Updated `app/challenger/quizzes/page.client.tsx`

**How it works**:
1. Click the Delete (trash) icon on any quiz you created
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. If confirmed, quiz is permanently deleted from database
4. Quiz is removed from the list without page reload

**Features**:
- ✅ Only shows for quiz owner
- ✅ Confirmation dialog before deletion
- ✅ Loading state during deletion
- ✅ Prevents multiple simultaneous deletions
- ✅ Optimistic UI update (removes from list immediately)

## UI Changes

### Quiz Cards
For quizzes you created, you now see two icon buttons in the top-right:
- **Edit icon** (pencil) - Opens edit page
- **Delete icon** (trash, red) - Deletes quiz with confirmation

Both buttons are disabled during deletion to prevent race conditions.

## Security

All operations are protected by:
- **Authentication**: Must be logged in
- **Authorization**: Only quiz creator can edit/delete
- **RLS Policies**: Database-level security ensures only owner has access
- **Confirmation**: Delete requires user confirmation

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a quiz
- [ ] Click Edit icon - should open edit page with pre-filled data
- [ ] Modify quiz details and save
- [ ] Verify changes appear in quiz list
- [ ] Click Delete icon - should show confirmation
- [ ] Cancel deletion - quiz should remain
- [ ] Click Delete again and confirm - quiz should be removed
- [ ] Try to edit/delete someone else's quiz - should not see buttons
- [ ] Test edit/delete while logged out - should be protected

## Known Limitations

1. **Question Editing**: Edit page currently only updates quiz metadata. Questions cannot be modified after creation. This will be enhanced in a future update to:
   - Edit existing questions
   - Delete questions
   - Add new questions to existing quiz

2. **Cascade Delete**: When deleting a quiz, associated questions and attempts are also deleted (handled by database CASCADE constraints).

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Full question editing capability
- [ ] Soft delete (mark as inactive instead of permanent deletion)
- [ ] Restore deleted quizzes
- [ ] Bulk delete multiple quizzes
- [ ] Quiz duplication feature
- [ ] Version history for quiz edits
